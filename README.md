# Simple-QnA-Chatbot

The QnA Chatbots are built with two Sources: Groq and Olama.

Groq also has many open-source free LLM models, in which you have to sign in and get your API key.
The LLM model in Ollama must be downloaded to your device.
You can add other LLM model options in the sidebar in the code as it's required.

All things are trackable in the Langsmith.

You can create the OpenAI Chatbot with almost the same code given in groq_app.py.
